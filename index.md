### Achievements

- [Third Place on CONBRAVA](http://conbrava.comercial.ws/site/en/home-en/)
<p style="font-size:14px">CONBRAVA is the biggest Congress about HVAC-R on Latin America. On November of 2021, I published a paper about an analysis on a photovoltaic air-conditioning system and among the incredible people that were there, I was voted to be the third best article in there. The article can be found in this [link](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)</p>
